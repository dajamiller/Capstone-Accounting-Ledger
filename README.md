# Quantify Financial Manager



## 📲 Features
- Make payments + deposits
- See your transactions
- Search transactions by vendor
- Get financial reports (month to date, previous year, and more!)

## 🔎 Interesting Code
I discovered how to implement the collections class to simplify the process of reversing the transaction entries.
